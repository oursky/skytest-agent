# SkyTest Agent - AI Coding Guidelines

Primary guidelines live in `docs/assistant-guidelines.md`.
Read it first for any task. Review and workflow playbooks are linked there.

## Workflow Expectations
- Align on intent and success criteria before coding.
- For non-trivial changes, capture design notes in `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-design.md`.
- For multi-step work, write a plan in `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`.
- Prefer test-first for new behavior; reproduce and trace root causes before fixes.
- Self-review spec compliance first, then code quality; verify before completion claims.
